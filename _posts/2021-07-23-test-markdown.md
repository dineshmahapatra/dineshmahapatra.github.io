Covid-19 has exposed the deep faultlines that hobble India’s transition towards a more digitally enabled society. During the pandemic, several essential services, ranging from access to healthcare services – including vaccines – to education, livelihoods, and rations — have felt the effects of unequal distribution of technology in the country. With increasing inequalities and the burden on systems, the need for digitally driven programmes is now more urgent than ever before

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```
