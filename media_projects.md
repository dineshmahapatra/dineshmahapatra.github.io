- Your Sky Our Land 
- It is an attempt to question the development paradigm of India which is catering to a small percent of the rich people in the society at the expense of others. The film takes Jari Mari, a slum, located in the heart of Mumbai city, as an example to elucidate the politics of the new  changing nation  which is trying its best to dislocate a population who toiled and worked hard to build the city.
 This film is trying to record the stories of those who are being systematically eliminated from the imagination of a Mumbai as a world- class city. It is the story of the people who are remembering their past in Jari Mari and their changing relationship with the city Mumbai.  It is a story of the fight of the slum dwellers to have their share in this fast developing city- Mumbai.
Jari Mari, once the periphery of Mumbai, now the heart of the city, is surrounded by airport development plans and Mithi river beautification project, creating a threat for the 20,000 people living in this area. This film is reposing the very often asked question again: what is this development and who is this development for?
