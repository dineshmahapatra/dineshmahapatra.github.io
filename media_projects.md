- It is an attempt to question the development paradigm of India which is catering to a small percent of the rich people in the society at the expense of others. The film takes Jari Mari, a slum, located in the heart of Mumbai city, as an example to elucidate the politics of the new  changing nation  which is trying its best to dislocate a population who toiled and worked hard to build the city.
 This film is trying to record the stories of those who are being systematically eliminated from the imagination of a Mumbai as a world- class city. It is the story of the people who are remembering their past in Jari Mari and their changing relationship with the city Mumbai.  It is a story of the fight of the slum dwellers to have their share in this fast developing city- Mumbai.
Jari Mari, once the periphery of Mumbai, now the heart of the city, is surrounded by airport development plans and Mithi river beautification project, creating a threat for the 20,000 people living in this area. This film is reposing the very often asked question again: what is this development and who is this development for?

- The phenomenon of caste operates in various ways in an urban setting. Though not explicitly seen, through everyday relationships, it subtly operates through mechanisms like language.
Although language seems like a natural or neutral phenomenon, one must realize its political nature. Through this film, we're attempting to delve deeper into the phenomenon of caste as operationalized within language, with respect to Marathi (as it is spoken in Mumbai), through its dialects.
 
Itâ€™s an attempt to raise certain questions, like the notion of pure and impure Marathi, and who holds power because of their access to 'pure' Marathi. We will also look at how a particular dialect becomes a marker for one's caste and leads to exclusion and/or discrimination at various levels. In an urban space, it is critical to look at the affect that the compulsion of unlearning one's caste dialect has, since it is not only about reworking one's vocabulary and individual habits, but also leads to an erasure of memory and association with one's community.
